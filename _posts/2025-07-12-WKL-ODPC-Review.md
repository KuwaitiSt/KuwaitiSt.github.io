In the middle of 2025, I made a decision to step back from everything else and focus fully on "Evasion", improving my Malware development skills, and to be better C programmer. I wanted to challenge myself with something real, a course with a LAB that has enterprise-level EDRs to implement my learnt skills on, and not just code and assume it would work.

## Course

That's when **Offensive Development Practitioner Certification (ODPC)** stood out to me.  The moment I saw that lab diagram, I knew this was exactly what I wanted.

The environment looked very realistic, and I just couldn't find any course that provide these EDRs for you to have your sweet time to test on. The lab has MDE, Bitdefender, Cortex, Crowdstrike, Elastic and Sophos. 

What made it even better is that the course also give you access to Cobalt strike and a development machine. For someone like me who treats red teaming and malware development as a hobby, it's not realistic to purchase something like Cobalt Strike on my own. Having it available inside the lab was a game changer for me.



### My learning Experience

In ODPC don't expect to be spoon fed anything. You learn by writing your custom code, researching and experimenting. The course give you access to a lot of injection techniques that you can implement with your loader, API resolution, indirect-syscalls and a lot more. The documentation of each technique and how to write the code is great and easy to follow. 


The course even goes deeper than just user-mode evasion. It dives deeper to kernel related subjects like BYOVD and Kernel-Callbacks. 

Overall, the learning experience was amazing, and exactly what I was looking for.



## Exam

The exam was built around four **HIGHLY** realistic machines, each designed to test your understanding and your ability to research and adapt. All I can say is that it was truly a great feeling to pass the exam (: .
